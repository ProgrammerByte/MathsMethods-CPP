# MathsMethods-CPP
My first C++ program. This program contains a variety of mathematical methods (some of which are derived from their respective Maclaurin series) including:  
-factorial  
-nPr and nCr formulae  
-sumX (between start and finish value)  
-binomial expansion  
-power (separate methods for when the exponent is an integer or a double)  
-root (nth integer root)  
-log and ln (better optimised as of 14/16/2020 compared to previous version)  
-fraction simplifier  
-Quadratic equation analyser (determines solutions and stationary point)  
-exp (exp's Maclaurin series is used for other methods)  
-sin (all angles are in radians)  
-arcSin  
-cos  
-arcCos  
-tan  
-arcTan  
-sinh  
-arcSinh  
-cosh  
-arcCosh  
-tanh  
-arcTanh  
-toDegrees (converts radians to degrees)  
-toRadians (converts degrees to radians)  
  
The constants PI and e are also defined within the code.  
All non exact calculations (for example ln, sin, and sinh) include an iterations parameter which determines the accuracy of the approximated calculation. A greater iterations parameter will increase the accuracy as well as the time taken to carry out the calculation.  
The program itself does nothing when executed as the main method only contains commented out lines of test code.
