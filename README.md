# MathsMethods-CPP
My first C++ program. This program contains a variety of mathematical methods (some of which are derived from their respective Maclaurin series) including:  
-factorial  
-sumX (between start and finish value)  
-binomial expansion  
-power (separate methods for when the exponent is an integer or a double)  
-root (nth integer root)  
-ln  
-fraction simplifier  
-exp (exp's Maclaurin series is used for other methods)  
-sin (all angles are in radians)  
-cos  
-tan  
-sinh  
-cosh  
-tanh  
  
The constants PI and e are also defined within the code.  
The program itself does nothing when executed as the main method only contains commented out lines of test code.
